# 🔐 Password Cracking & Hashing Algorithms

This project explores core cybersecurity concepts like password hashing, salting, and cracking using dictionary attacks. It is designed for beginners who want hands-on experience with how real-world password security mechanisms work.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🔍 Demonstrates password hashing using common algorithms (SHA-256, MD5, SHA-1)
- 🧂 Explains the importance of adding salt to protect against rainbow table attacks
- 🕵️‍♀️ Simulates a basic dictionary attack to crack a hashed password
- ⚙️ Built using Python and executed in Visual Studio Code

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.x**
- **Visual Studio Code**
- Built-in Python `hashlib` library
- Custom wordlist file (`wordlist.txt`)

## 💡 Key Concepts Covered

| Concept         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Hashing**     | One-way encryption that turns a password into a fixed-length string. |
| **Salting**     | Random data added to passwords before hashing to prevent hash reuse. |
| **Dictionary Attack** | Using a list of common passwords to guess the original input. |
| **Brute Force** | Trying every possible password until the correct one is found. |
